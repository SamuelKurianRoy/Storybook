But in his gaze, she saw not judgment, but a strange and steady tenderness. She said yes.</p>

This firstborn, Hosea's own son, was a prophecy of sorrow, a shadow falling over their new family. But the quiet of Hosea's home felt like a cage to Gomer, and her eyes began to stray back toward the wild, chaotic life she had known.</p>

It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.
